# Submission Reminder (Shell Script)

# How it works

- Prompts for user's name
- Creates a folder: `submission_reminder_<user_name>`
- Sets up necessary(provided) files under the folder for the program to work
- When you run the reminder, it tells you who hasnâ€™t submitted

## How to run

1. chmod +x create_environment.sh
2. ./create_environment.sh
3. Navigate to submission_reminder_<user_name>
4. ./startup.sh
