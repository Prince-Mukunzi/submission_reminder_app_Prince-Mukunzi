# Submission Reminder App (Shell Script)

## Get Set up – Environment
1. chmod +x create_environment.sh
2. ./create_environment.sh
3. Navigate to submission_reminder_<user_name>
4. ./startup.sh 

## Get set up – Copilot
1. chmod +x copilot_shell_script.sh
2. ./copilot_shell_script 

## How it works – Environment

- Prompts for user's name
- Creates a folder: `submission_reminder_<user_name>`
- Sets up necessary(provided) files under the folder for the program to work
- When you run the app<startup.sh>, it tells you who hasn’t submitted <assignment> Default: "Shell navigation"


## How it works – Copilot
1. Prompts user name–must be the same as user name used in Environment
3. Prompts assignment to check
4. Runs the reminder and tells you who hasn't submitted specified assignment
